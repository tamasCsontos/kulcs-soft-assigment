After you started the heroku server at https://mysterious-springs-56205.herokuapp.com/api/users, you should wait a bit for the
server to get going. Then you can start the angular client after running npm install with ng serve.





This was my first time that i used angular with spring boot, and spring security. Spring security got the better of me.
I haven't used that much of spring security it was a heavy subject in such a short time, especially to get angular to work with it.
I will try to dig in to this subject in the next weeks.
